Hi, I'm Alex.

Welcome to my humble website. I write about anything I'd like to read myself, whether technical or not.

I'm interested in all ways we can use data for positive impact.

Recently graduated Computer Science MS from UC San Diego specializing in Machine Learning and AI. Before that, I graduated Computer Science BS from UC Santa Barbara with a minor in statistics. Actively looking for a job in the Bay Area or remote. If you're hiring, don't hesitate to reach me via LinkedIn or email!

If you're curious how I created this website, I talk about that [here](/blog/how-i-created-this-website/).
