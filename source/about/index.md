Hi, I'm Alex, an aspiring data scientist and lifelong learner.

I'm interested in all the ways we can use data for positive impact. For me, data science is about asking questions and using data to find answers. However, I recognize data cannot answer the majority of questions we may have. In this website, I explore those questions.

I write about anything I'd like to read myself, whether technical or not.

I recently graduated Computer Science MS from UC San Diego specializing in Machine Learning and AI. Before that, I graduated Computer Science BS from UC Santa Barbara with a minor in statistics. Actively looking for a job in the Bay Area or remote. If you're hiring, don't hesitate to reach me via LinkedIn or email!

If you're curious how I created this website, I wrote about that [here](/blog/how-i-created-this-website/).
