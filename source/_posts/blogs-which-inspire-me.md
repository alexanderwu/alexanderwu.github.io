I like reading blogs in my free time.

## Blogs are awesome because...

* Authors of blogs are often unbiased
  * Authors can write their unfiltered thoughts if they aren't paid to write it. If you're writing for free, you know it's got to be at least a little important to the author.
* It's like a deep conversation with someone you may never meet in person
  * Words are like crystallized experiences. Why not learn from other people's hard-won lessons? No need to learn the hard way.

## Some resources on why to blog
