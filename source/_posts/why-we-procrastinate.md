## We procrastinate because...

_1. We set our expectations too high_
  
* **Solution:** Break it down to mangeable pieces. Take a deep breath. Think -- what is the next physical action?

_2. Perfectionism_
  
* **Solution:** "Done is better than perfect"
  * Tell yourself that _perfect_ does not actually exist
  * Consider the tradeoffs between making something "perfect" and using that time and energy for something else
  * Get started if you have 70% of the resources and 70% sure you will succeed

_3. Lacking purpose_
  
* **Solution:** Focus on WHY
  * "He who has a why can bear almost any how." -- Friedrich Nietzsche

_4. Fear_
  
* **Solution:** Be clear about what you are afraid of
  * We naturally fear what we can't control, like the dark. So shine a light.
  * Imagine you're a storybook hero. Have courage. Face your fears.
  * Instead of feeling afraid to fail, tell yourself that you are excited to learn

_5. Bad self-management_
  
* **Solution:** Schedule a block of time
  * At the end of the alloted time, reflect on what has been accomplished and what are the next steps

_6. We only work well with external pressure_
  
* **Solution:** Impose artificial deadlines
  * Ever notice how you're 10x productive on the last day? Because at the eleventh hour, you comprehend the consequences of your actions so viscerally.
  * Better yet, figure out what you need to be internally motivated. Fighting yourself won't work in the long run. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

_7. Distractions_
  
* **Solution:** Proactively eliminate distractions
  * Put your phone on silent
  * Close that YouTube tab
  * etc.
