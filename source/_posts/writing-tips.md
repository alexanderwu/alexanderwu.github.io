I may not practice what I preach, but here are my condensed notes to remind myself how to write. A checklist, if you will. Hopefully it proves useful. Without further ado:

* Outline what you have to say.
* Omit needless words. Be concise. Economize.
* Consider your audience. Have something worth saying. Write with a _purpose_.
* Be specific. Prioritize action verbs over adverbs and descriptive nouns over adjectives.
* Show, don't tell. Involve the senses.
* State your objecetive upfront, don't make the reader dig for it.
* Write what you'd like to read yourself. Writing is a dialogue, not a checkbox.

If you're stuck...

* Define words specific to your topic. This is especially important if there's no consensus on what the terms mean.
  * Let's say you're writing about "Artificial Intelligence". Do people even agree what it means?<sup>[1](#note1)</sup> In your own words, write down your definition. Then consider, what do I have to add to this discussion?
* Have a way to jot down and capture ideas that occur sporadically throughout the day.
  * For me, that's editing markdown files with Sublime Text. Or if I'm on the road, I use Google Keep on my phone<sup>[2](#note2)</sup>.
* Most importantly, you just have to _do it_.
  * Exercise your writing muscles. You ain't gonna get buff by reading biophysics. Just _hit the gym_<sup>[3](#note3)</sup>. Just _do it_.

  <div><a name="note2">2</a> I'd personally recommend Visual Studio Code as a text editor. Typora looks neat for editing markdown specifically. Google Keep is cool too, but I'm sure there's plenty of better options out there (I haven't bothered to research)</div>
  <div><a name="note3">3</a> i.e. sit down and write. I don't literally mean go to the gym -- it's a metaphor.</div>
